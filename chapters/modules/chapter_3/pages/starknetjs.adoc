= Starknet.js - Starknet JavaScript SDK

Starknet.js is a library that helps connect your website or decentralized application (D-App) to Starknet, using the JavaScript/TypeScript language.

The library aims to mimic https://docs.ethers.org/v5/[ethers.js] in architecture, so if you are familiar with ethers, you should be quite familiar with Starknet.js!
